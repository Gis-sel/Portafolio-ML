        "## Conclusión, Errores e Impacto Financiero\n",
        "\n",
        "Este proyecto tuvo como objetivo desarrollar y evaluar modelos de Deep Learning (DNN y MLP residual) para clasificar riesgos de crédito utilizando el conjunto de datos Statlog (German Credit Data).\n",
        "\n",
        "Durante el desarrollo, se encontraron y abordaron algunos **errores notables**:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Errores de forma (`ValueError`)**: Se presentó un error recurrente relacionado con la forma de los datos, particularmente al pasar los datos procesados a los modelos para entrenamiento y predicción, y al intentar calcular los valores SHAP. Aunque se esperaba que los datos procesados tuvieran 61 características, en algunos puntos se detectó una forma inesperada (por ejemplo, con 36 características). Esto subraya la importancia de verificar y asegurar la consistencia de las dimensiones de los datos a lo largo de todo el pipeline. Para el Permutation Importance, se resolvió envolviendo el modelo Keras en una clase con un método `fit` simulado.\n",
        "*   **Error de `permutation_importance` (`InvalidParameterError`)**: La función de scikit-learn `permutation_importance` requería que el estimador tuviera un método `fit`, lo cual no es estándar para modelos Keras envueltos de esta manera. Se solucionó añadiendo un método `fit` vacío a la clase `KerasWrapper`.\n",
        "\n",
        "A pesar de estos desafíos técnicos, se logró entrenar y evaluar los modelos. La métrica clave de evaluación fue el AUC, donde el **MLP Residual** mostró un rendimiento ligeramente superior (AUC={metrics_res['auc']:.3f}) en comparación con la DNN base (AUC={metrics_dnn['auc']:.3f}) en el conjunto de prueba. La métrica F1 también se consideró relevante debido al desbalance de clases, siendo para el MLP Residual de {metrics_res['f1']:.3f} y para la DNN base de {metrics_dnn['f1']:.3f}.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Impacto Financiero y Comparación de Gravedad de Errores Tipo I y Tipo II\n",
        "\n",
        "En el contexto de la evaluación de crédito, los **errores de clasificación** tienen un impacto financiero directo:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Error Tipo I (Falso Positivo - FP)**: El modelo predice que un cliente tendrá buen crédito, pero en realidad tiene mal crédito (apruebas a alguien que no pagará).\n",
        "    *   **Impacto Financiero**: Pérdida directa del monto del crédito otorgado, costos de cobranza y posibles daños a la relación con el cliente (si se intenta cobrar agresivamente).\n",
        "    *   **Gravedad**: Generalmente considerado **más grave** en la evaluación de crédito, ya que resulta en una pérdida financiera tangible e irrecuperable.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Error Tipo II (Falso Negativo - FN)**: El modelo predice que un cliente tendrá mal crédito, pero en realidad tiene buen crédito (rechazas a alguien que sí pagaría).\n",
        "    *   **Impacto Financiero**: Pérdida de una oportunidad de negocio rentable, pérdida de ingresos por intereses futuros y posible daño a la reputación si el cliente rechaza se va a la competencia.\n",
        "    *   **Gravedad**: Menos grave que el Error Tipo I en términos de pérdida directa, pero significativo por la pérdida de ingresos potenciales y la base de clientes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Comparación de Gravedad**: En la mayoría de las instituciones financieras, el **Error Tipo I es significativamente más costoso y perjudicial** que el Error Tipo II. Es más importante evitar aprobar un crédito incobrable que perder una oportunidad de negocio, aunque ambos son importantes. El desbalance de clases en el dataset (más créditos buenos que malos) refleja esta realidad, donde la clase minoritaria (mal crédito) es la de mayor interés para identificar y evitar.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Estrategias de Gestión del Modelo\n",
        "\n",
        "Para desplegar y gestionar este modelo en un entorno real, se sugieren las siguientes estrategias:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Calibración del Umbral de Decisión**: El umbral por defecto de 0.5 para la clasificación puede no ser el óptimo dado el costo asimétrico de los errores Tipo I y II. Se debe calibrar el umbral basándose en una matriz de costos financieros (que refleje las pérdidas por FP y las ganancias perdidas por FN) para minimizar el costo total esperado.\n",
        "2.  **Validación Cruzada (k-fold)**: Para obtener una estimación más robusta del rendimiento del modelo y reducir la dependencia de una única división train/test, se debería implementar validación cruzada.\n",
        "3.  **Análisis de Sesgos y Características Proxy**: Investigar si el modelo presenta sesgos hacia ciertos grupos demográficos y si las características utilizadas actúan como proxies injustos. Abordar estos sesgos es crucial para una implementación ética y justa.\n",
        "4.  **Monitoreo en Producción**: Una vez desplegado, el modelo debe ser monitoreado continuamente para detectar la deriva de datos (cambios en la distribución de las características de entrada) y la deriva de concepto (cambios en la relación entre las características y la variable objetivo). Esto es vital para mantener la precisión del modelo a lo largo del tiempo.\n",
        "5.  **Explicabilidad Continua**: Utilizar técnicas como SHAP o Permutation Importance de forma regular para entender las razones detrás de las predicciones del modelo, lo cual es útil para la auditoría, la confianza y la mejora del modelo.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusión Final\n",
        "\n",
        "El modelo MLP Residual mostró un rendimiento prometedor en la clasificación de riesgo de crédito, superando ligeramente a la DNN base en métricas clave como el AUC. Si bien se superaron desafíos técnicos durante el desarrollo, la implementación en un entorno real requiere una cuidadosa consideración del impacto financiero asimétrico de los errores de clasificación, una calibración adecuada del umbral de decisión y una estrategia robusta de monitoreo y gestión para garantizar un rendimiento confiable y justo a lo largo del tiempo."
